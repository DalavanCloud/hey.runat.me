I'm Matt Bierbaum, an Nth year [physics](http://www.physics.cornell.edu/)
graduate student at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/).  I study a
variety of different topics which you can find in the [science](/pages/science)
heading.  I also have many, varied interests that you can find throughout this
site, the main one being bikes (surprisingly underrepresented currently).  Have
fun, look around, and get in touch if you find something interesting.

I'd be happy to send a CV upon request.
