As part of the
{{ref('docs/science/moshpits.yaml')}} project, I
created an interactive simulation in javascript.  Initially just to learn about
the basics of HTML5 canvas, it become very useful for exploring parameter space
and also become very popular on 'teh internetz' when interest in the project
picked up.

I even created an embeddable version where the controls are hidden so as to 
maximize space utility.  It was included in articles on:

 * [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2013/03/22/174962714/mosh-pit-math-physicists-analyze-rowdy-crowd) - 
   a very nice article with interviews at the APS March Meeting in 2013.

 * [metalitalia](http://metalitalia.com/articolo/la-legge-fisica-che-regolamenta-il-mosh-pit/)

The main page has more information on what exactly is going on in the
simulation.  Also, the source code is available on my github
[here](https://github.com/mattbierbaum/moshpits.js).
