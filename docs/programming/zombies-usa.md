We all know that a zombie infestation is inevitable, so why not try to
understand the effects on the US with a simulation.  We made such a simulation
for the web in which all 308 million people from the 2010 census interact
locally in the US.  The dynamics are Gillespie dynamics in which every possible
interaction is considered at each time step.  

The source code is available on github
