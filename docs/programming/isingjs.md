which performs Ising model simulations", 700, 'center') }}

Created a basic simulation of the ising model in two dimensions using the ultra
portable Javascript.  Runs cross browser and does some very basic analysis
including graphs and time series output to csv data files.  Metropolis
algorithm is of course available and Alemi implemented the Wolff agorithm.

This program is essentially a copy of Jim Sethna's SSS Ising program
written in tcl.  The source code is available on my github
[here](https://github.com/mattbierbaum/ising.js).
