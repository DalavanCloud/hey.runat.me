Do you find the addresses from URL shorteners like bit.ly and goo.gl impossible
to remember?  Well, we've got a URL shortener for you.  When you go to
[yo.runat.me](http://yo.runat.me), we suggest an English word (typically a
noun) for a shortened URL.  And better yet, this URL turns into an english
sentence - "Yo, run at me, [bro](http://yo.runat.me/bro)".  We regret that we
don't report click statistics, or have many of the other features of other
shorteners, but yah know.  Maybe sometime.

You can also specify your own noun by going to [yo.runat.me/&lt;noun&gt;](http://yo.runat.me/noun).
If it is not taken, you can fill in the URL to which it forwards.  Enjoy.

{{ biglink('http://yo.runat.me', 'yo.runat.me/') }}
