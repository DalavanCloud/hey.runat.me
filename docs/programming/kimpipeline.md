OpenKIM (Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models) is a large scale material science
community effort to standardize the use of interatomic potentials and other
models.  It is a programming API, database of tests and models, a computational
pipeline for testing the models, and a web frontend to explore the system.

During my time at Cornell, I was involved in developing the pipeline to compute
arbitrary molecular dynamics simulations using the models that have been 
submitted to KIM.  Rather than repeat old information, I'll just let it speak
for itself.  A description of the pipeline and its resources can be found 
<a href='https://pipeline.openkim.org/docs/'>here</a>, while a look into the 
pipeline activity can be found
